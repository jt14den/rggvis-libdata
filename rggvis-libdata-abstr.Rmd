Creating interactive web graphics often requires classic challenges associated with **extract load and transform** operations. Data needs to be acquired, tidied, transformed and then sent to a web app for rendering. Each of these activities and steps can require different set of technical skills or alternately significant investiment in a proprietary tool.  This leads to a barrier for a analyst or librarian to effectively explore data and create interactive graphics in a flexible, iterative way in single language. This chapter will cover how a recent **R** package **ggvis** lets analysts build interactive graphics for exploratory data analysis.  **how will we do this and what's the outcome** we will provide code samples in github and brief tutorials. 
**begin by installing the R & ggvis and components** for ease of x the author will provide a virtual machine. 
We will begin the chapter by intoducting how ggvis utilizes the *grammar of graphics* to break graphs into composable components made up of data, coordinate system, mark type and properities. This allows us to easily alter these graphical components to make thousands of different graphic types.  We a basic grasp of the *grammar of graphics* we will start to use *ggvis* to build simple static graphs in R-Studio using canned library datasets the author will provide.  We will demonstrate how these graphics are rendered in html in our R-Studio graphic viewer. We will also introduce other important features the **ggvis** packages gives us. For example. We will also explore *ggvis*'s ability to plug into the *maggrittr* package and string together complex data pipelines in creating graphics. We sill also show how **ggvis** employs features from the **dplyr** package to manipulate and transform the data for graphing. 

starting with interactive components (new word for compent).  
introduce rmarkdown, show how to embedded graphic and run in rstudio, cover idea of creating dynamic documents. 
introduce rpubs - publish to rpubs
