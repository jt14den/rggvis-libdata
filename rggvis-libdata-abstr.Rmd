Creating interactive web graphics often requires classic challenges associated with **extract load and transform** operations. Data needs to be acquired, tidied, transformed and then sent to a web app for rendering. Each of these activities and steps can require different set of technical skills or alternately significant investiment in a proprietary tool.  This leads to a barrier for a analyst or librarian to effectively explore data and create interactive graphics in a flexible, iterative way in single language. This chapter will cover how a recent R package *ggvis* lets analysts build interactive graphics for exploratory data analysis. We will begin the chapter by intoducting how ggvis utilizes the *grammar of graphics* to break graphs into composable components made up of data, coordinate system, mark type and properities. This allows us to easily alter these graphical components to make thousands of different graphic types.  We a basic graspe of the grammar of graphics we will start to use *ggvis* to build simple static graphs in R-Studio.  We will also explore *ggvis* ability to plug into the *maggrittr* package and create complex data pipelines in creating graphics. Often compared to legos, these components We will also explore *ggvis* ability to plug into the *maggrittr* package and create complex data pipelines in creating graphics. Using library data, such as, catalog data, head count, electroic resources, to As part of builing up to devloping the graphics we will introduce important concpets like the grammar of graphics and data pipelines.  I'll introduce a nuber of R packages that will aid us in loading and cleaning data. As part of the outcome of this chapter the reader should be able to create a interactive graphic of library data.
