One of the biggest problems in creating interactive graphics is that it typically requires an significant investment in a proprietary tool or large technical knowledge of both web application development and statistical programming to create meaningful graphic. This leads to a barrier for exploring data in interative way with interactive graphics.  This chapter will cover how to use *ggvis* in the free statistical computing tool, R, to build an interactive graphics for exploratory data analysis. We will begin the chapter by intoducting the *grammar of graphics* and how ggvis utilizes this approach as to break up visualizations into components.  We will also explore *ggvis* ability to plug into the *maggrittr* package and create complex data pipelines in creating graphics. Often compared to legos, these components We will also explore *ggvis* ability to plug into the *maggrittr* package and create complex data pipelines in creating graphics. 
Using library data, such as, catalog data, head count, electroic resources, to As part of builing up to devloping the graphics we will introduce important concpets like the grammar of graphics and data pipelines.  I'll introduce a nuber of R packages that will aid us in loading and cleaning data. As part of the outcome of this chapter the reader should be able to create a interactive graphic of library data.
