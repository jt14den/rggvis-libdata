R is a statiscal programming language used extensively in both business and academic settings. It has shown dramatic growth in the past decade and is the most dominate statiscal programming language. `ggvis` is an R package developed by William Chen and Hadley Wickham that employs the grammar of graphics in making data visualizations.  The goal of the package is to make it easier for people to employ visualiztions on the web either through interactive visualizations that can be embedded in interactive vis or in web docs. This chapter will cover how to R and ggvis to jbuild an interactive diagrams of library data.  As part of builing up to devloping the graphics we will introduce important concpets like the grammar of graphics and data pipelines.  I'll introduce a nuber of R packages that will aid us in loading and cleaning data. As part of the outcome of this chapter the reader should be able to create a interactive graphic of library data.
